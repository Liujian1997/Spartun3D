You need to generate at least 10 meaningful question-answer pairs based on the scene information in Python list format. Ask questions about object types, counting, attributes, positions between me, and relative position between objects by comparing the angles of all other objects to determine which one lies to the left/right of the reference object based on their relative positions. The question must be answered based on my current position and conform to the scene information among objects. Do not use the IDs of the objects in the question and answer. Do not consider the object's utility and affordance. Do not use the number of turn degrees or distance meters in the question and answer. There are several examples:
